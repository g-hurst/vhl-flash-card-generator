### NOTE (9/28/2022): I am running to class and have not yet updated this page after the most recent push 
### Inspiration:

I am taking a language in college. In order to study, flash cards are SUPER helpful. However, it is painful to make them (especially with large word sets). I wrote this script to automate the process. 

### How it works:

This program scrapes the vocab words from a [VHL](https://www.vhlcentral.com/) page generates flash cards to study with. 


### Usage:

1. Install the [Chrome Driver](https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/) and put the exe in the project directory. The driver can also be changed within the program if another broweser is prefered.
2. Run the program and enter:
    * your VHL username
    * your VHL password
    * the URL of the vocabulary page to scrape
3. Study away!!!
